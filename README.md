[00:21.94] Do you feel alone ？
[00:24.87] Can you hear me now ？
[00:27.77] Your mind is so far away still on earth
[00:33.39] Many times you are hurting yourself
[00:36.24] You can't be just a life on the shelf
[00:39.33] It's only you that can fly this new unicorn
[00:41.98] Into the sky
[00:44.16] And it's every time, you hurt yourself with knives
[00:49.82] And I'm calling, calling out your name again
[00:55.37] If you're holding, holding onto fear I knew
[01:00.72] The blind can open, let light shine through
[01:06.56] And I say
[01:07.70] Why we can't stop all this sacrifice ？
[01:13.27] I know that all the lies became the stone in your heart
[01:18.83] I wonder how long you gonna survive
[01:24.56] We didn't see all it's meaning
[01:29.86] You are the one for me
[01:32.61] Finally I can see
[01:35.49] Can you promise me
[01:36.83] You'll come back safe and help me ？
[01:40.92] I'm counting on you to bring the peace we all deserve
[01:45.77] And maybe we'll be able to continue
[01:51.32] And it's every time, you hurt yourself with knives
[01:56.83] And I'm calling, calling out your name again
[02:02.44] If you're holding, holding onto fear I knew
[02:07.83] The blind can open, let light shine through
[02:13.69] And I say
[02:14.89] Why we can't stop all this sacrifice ？
[02:20.39] I know that all the lies became the stone in your heart
[02:25.86] I wonder how long you gonna survive
[02:31.56] We didn't see all it's meaning
[02:58.23] And it's every time, you hurt yourself with knives
[03:03.84] And I'm calling, calling out your name again
[03:09.34] If you're holding, holding onto fear I knew
[03:14.92] The blind can open, let light shine through
[03:20.47] And I say
[03:21.78] Why we can't stop all this sacrifice ？
[03:27.40] I know that all the lies became the stone in your heart
[03:32.94] I wonder how long you gonna survive
[03:38.40] We didn't see all it's meaning
