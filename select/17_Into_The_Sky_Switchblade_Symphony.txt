The pushers
The shakers
The feelers
The fakers
The loudness
The silence
The feelers
The fakers
My wings will pull me
Up into the sky
[Words sung with megaphone]
The feelings that I have
They haunt me till I'm mad
The heroes
The villains
The daring
Decisions
My wings will pull me
Up into the sky
[Words sung with megaphone]
